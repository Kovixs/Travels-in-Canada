                        <h1>Eight</h1>
                        <p>As the name would suggest, this is a eight-seat, high-concept restaurant by chef Darren MacLean that’s only open three nights a week. If you’re lucky enough to get a reservation at this kitchen bar, expect a tasting menu that is a love letter to Canadian cuisine and ingredients. More than just a meal, dining at Eight is a conversational, interactive experience.</p>

                    <h1>Mimi</h1> 
                    <p>Toronto’s hottest new ticket, this bustling uptown spot from chefs David Schwartz and David Chong has a careful and complex menu of sharing plates inspired by the diverse regions of China. Poetic and balanced, this is truly elevated Chinese cuisine. Add in some great service and a cocktail list that packs a punch, and Mimi is a recipe for success in Toronto’s competitive food scene.</p>

                    <h1>Jinbar</h1> 
                    <p>Chef Jinhee Lee elevates comforting snack foods by infusing them with the flavours from her childhood in Korea, from beef bulgogi tacos to buldak pizza. The real star is the Korean fried chicken, available in four flavours, which is often reviewed as the best in the city.</p>

                    <h1>Native Tounges</h1> 
                    <p>This Mexican cantina offers up mezcal-forward cocktails and authentic Latin cuisine that is worth the wait (and you should expect one at this hip spot!). Expect a warm and lively atmosphere that’s as spirited as their cocktails, and don’t miss the pork belly tacos.</p>

                    <h1>The Acorn</h1> 
                    <p>Visit this Main Street restaurant for elevated plant-based dining, including a much-loved weekend brunch that’s full of surprising globally-inspired dishes like a savoury mushroom waffle or okonomiyaki. Vegetables take center stage with chef Devon Latte’s uniquely curated menu that’s worth a visit for vegans, carnivores, and everyone in between.</p>

                    <h1>Alo</h1> 
                    <p>Alo, led by chef and owner Patrick Kriss, has topped nearly every best restaurant list and we’d be remiss to leave this contemporary French restaurant off our list. Two dining services allow guests to choose from a blind tasting menu or enjoy the famed cuisine a la carte. We recommend booking in before its Michelin star is inevitably announced this fall.</p>
